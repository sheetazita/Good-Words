# Good-Words

## Project Description
The goal of "Good Words" app is to provide encouraging, inspiring vereses from Bible to help people in their difficult times, to give them comforting or help them find hopes in lives.  By generating daily encouraging verses about love, faith, or hope, people might find the source of light in their dark valley moment.  "Good Words" app also provide various of gift choices relate to the verse user generate, so when the users want to get something with Biblical meaning for their love one, the app could be a very helpful resources to them. 

## Major Challenges
Backend data for the Bible verses and the gift suggestions will be hard coded using Ruby on Rails, that will takes me some times.  The gift suggestions are relevant to the Bible verse each time the user click the generate button, so it takes time for me to figure out ways to build such function.

## MVP
Users will be able to register account, log in in order to see gift suggestions and create, revise, or delete their own one.  Users will be able to generate encouraging, inspiring Bible verse from a button without having to register or log in an account.  

## Post MVP
* Background picture will be auto-change depends on the current weather of the built-in calendar. 
* Image of gift list will be able to upload from users' own local server via pc or phone instead of restrictly pasting image url from other hosts.
* Users will be able to do keyword search for the Bible verse in typical topic.
